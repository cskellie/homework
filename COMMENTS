## SLCSP HOMEWORK

I completed this homework problem. Follow the instructions to compile and run the java source code.

PRE-BUILD SETUP
INSTALL JAVA:
	LINUX (UBUNTU)
	1) Run the following command:
		sudo apt-get install default-jdk 
			OR 
		sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
	2) Set the JAVA_HOME environmental variable.
	3) Run the following command to ensure successful install:
		java -version

INSTALL MAVEN: 
	LINUX (UBUNTU)
	1) Run the following command:
		sudo apt-get install maven
	2) Run the following command to ensure successful install:
		mvn --version

RUN MVN BUILD:
	1) Navigate to the directory where you unboxed the java source code.
	2) Run the following command:
		mvn clean install
	3) There should exist a .jar file in the target/ directory.
	
RUN APPLET:
	1) Run the following command to run the applet:
		java -jar {PATH_TO_JAR}/slcsp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar arg1
		NOTE:
			arg1 -> This is the .csv input file.
					This file must contain a 'zipcode' column.
					This file must contain a 'rate' column.
	2) Navigate to the .csv input file -> it has been modified in place.
	3) Open it up to compare values.
	
NOTES:
	1) My answer key exists at {PATH_TO_SOURCE}/slcsp.csv.
	2) This applet should process any file size as long as the .csv contains the required columns.
